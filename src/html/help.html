		<h3>Google Meet Attendance Help</h3>
		<hr/>
		<p>If you've found this page, you've already cleared the first hurdle to getting help - well done!  But admittedly, it is still pretty rudimentary.  </p>
		<p>This page is still included for legacy reasons... click the blue question mark at the below your class list to see the current Help functionality</p>

		<hr />
		<h3>Other Links</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>I will post updates to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GoogleMeetAttendance/" target="_blank" title='More timely feedback perhaps' >Google Meet Attendance FaceBook</a> page
			<li>If you're a code-geek, you can see the source code at the <a href="https://github.com/al-caughey/Google-Meet-Attendance/" target="_blank" title='See all of the code here...' >GitHub Repository</a> 
			<li>To provide constructive feedback, click <a href="https://github.com/al-caughey/Google-Meet-Attendance/issues" target="_blank" title='Report issues / send kudos...'>this link</a> and then click the green `New Issue` button.  Please provide as much info as possible (screenshots usually really help).  If there are `bad` entries in your list of attendees, paste or attach that to the issue as well.
			<li>I've kept the privacy and license details very short: <a href="https://github.com/al-caughey/Google-Meet-Attendance/blob/master/PRIVACY.md" target="_blank" title=''>Privacy</a> & <a href="https://github.com/al-caughey/Google-Meet-Attendance/blob/master/LICENSE.md" target="_blank" title=''>License</a>
